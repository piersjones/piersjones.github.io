<p>Confused? Don’t worry, so was I.</p>
<p>In an attempt to target a younger and more progressive audience, this luxury car brand have partnered with the British-Kosovan artist, Dua Lipa.</p>
<p>Dua will not only perform a duet with the new Jaguar I-PACE (yes, a duet with a car) but an app will also be available for her fans to remix her latest track &#8216;Want To&#8217; according to their Jaguar I-PACE driving data.</p>
<p>Apparently over a million (very expensive) remixes are available.</p>

<p>Snapchat publishers such as Refinery29 and Daily Mail will now be allowed to build stories from the videos created by Snap’s 188 million daily users.</p>
<p>But how does it work? Well, Snap publishers will have access to the app’s content management system which will basically allow them to search through the public videos uploaded.</p>
<p>Publishers will even be able to search through themes and locations to potentially build stories around anything and everything!</p>
